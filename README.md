# HTML + CSS Projects

Welcome to my collection of HTML and CSS projects! This repository showcases a variety of web development projects built using HTML and CSS. These projects demonstrate my understanding of web design and responsive layout techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages
- **CSS**: For styling the web pages and creating a responsive design
- **Flexbox**: For layout and positioning of elements
- **Grid**: For more complex layouts (if used)
- **Media Queries**: For making the pages responsive across different devices
